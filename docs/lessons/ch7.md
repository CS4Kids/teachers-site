#### Apply multiple methods of encryption to model the secure transmission of information.

Encryption can be as simple as letter substitution or as complicated as modern methods used to secure networks and the Internet. Students should encode and decode messages using a variety of encryption methods, and they should understand the different levels of complexity used to hide or secure information. For example, students could secure messages using methods such as Caesar cyphers or steganography (i.e., hiding messages inside a picture or other data). They can also model more complicated methods, such as public key encryption, through unplugged activities.

#### Assignment and Rubric: Let's Encrypt

In this chapter, you learned about different methods of encryption used to protect data. Practice your knowledge by converting a message using an encryption technique of your choice, and challenging others to decipher it. Research and try:  

- A Caesar cipher

- A Vigenère cipher

- An encryption technique of your choice

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement 
---|---|---
The student creates an encrypted message and partners with a peer to try to decrypt it, noting the necessity of understanding the type of encryption used and the key needed, if brute force decryption proves fruitless | The student only creates an encrypted message but can explain the encryption type they used and the key needed to decrypt it | The student simply creates the encrypted message.
