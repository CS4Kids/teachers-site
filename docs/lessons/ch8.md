#### Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases.

Use cases and test cases are created and analyzed to better meet the needs of users and to evaluate whether programs function as intended. At this level, testing should become a deliberate process that is more iterative, systematic, and proactive than at lower levels. Students should begin to test programs by considering potential errors, such as what will happen if a user enters invalid input (e.g., negative numbers and 0 instead of positive numbers).

#### Learning Outcomes/Goals

In this chapter, students learn about the important mandate to test software to discover bugs, fix them, and improve the quality of the product. The storyline talks about how the various parts of the moss-protection strategy seem to have fit together into a full system that could probably be tested so as to ensure that it continues to function as expected and keep the moss safe.

Students discover the various types of testing, including unit tests, regression testing, integration testing, and a full system test. They are encouraged to look at a real software test that checks a form to check whether a field is filled in. This software can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/CS4Kids/Sample-Test).

Research how decisions are made by engineers to build hardware and software solutions appropriate for the task at hand and for the environment where they will be embedded. Sketch out a design for an optimal trap for fireflies. | Write a summary of the trap's goals and outcome, and outline three ways that the trap would be designed to withstand outdoor conditions.

#### Assignment and Rubric: Time to Test

> Now that you have practiced designing a test suite for your Secure Moss prototype, create a five-part test suite outline for a system in real life. Find a web site that you can test. Think about the elements on the site that would benefit from having a solid test behind them. An example would be a login form on Fidelity.com, which has several fields and a button to log in. Even a simple form could have many tests to check for the integrity of the form. Use the attached worksheet on our web site to build out a suite for one element of a public-facing web site. 

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement 
---|---|---
The student creates a five part test suite with detailed instructions on the elements to test, and how to handle their various states | The student creates a minimal test plan | The student fails to show the minimal plan with its various states outlined
