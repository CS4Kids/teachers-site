#### Represent data using multiple encoding schemes.

Data representations occur at multiple levels of abstraction, from the physical storage of bits to the arrangement of information into organized formats (e.g., tables). Students should represent the same data in multiple ways. For example, students could represent the same color using binary, RGB values, hex codes (low-level representations), as well as forms understandable by people, including words, symbols, and digital displays of the color (high-level representations).

#### Assignment and Rubric: Representing Data

> Data can be represented in many different ways. Geodes, for example, come in many shapes and forms, with different types of crystals inside. Colors can be represented by RGB or HEX, and sizes can be represented by millimeters or centimeters. Give five examples of a thing that can be represented in different ways. Use the downloadable worksheet to organize your work. Be sure to include both a low-level and a high-level representation of a given value, such as colors. 

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement 
---|---|---
The student creates a creative prototype that includes a design for hardware, software, and at least one other sensor | The student creates a prototype that lacks creativity or one of the required elements | The student creates only a basic prototype that lacks sophistication
