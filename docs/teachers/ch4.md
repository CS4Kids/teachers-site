### Discuss issues of bias and accessibility in the design of existing technologies. 

Students should test and discuss the usability of various technology tools (e.g., apps, games, and devices) with  the teacher's guidance. For example, facial recognition software that works better for lighter skin tones was likely developed with a homogeneous testing group and could be improved by sampling a more diverse  population. When discussing accessibility, students may notice that allowing a user to change font sizes and  colors will not only make an interface usable for people with low vision but also benefits users in various situations, such as in bright daylight or a dark room.
