### Design projects that combine hardware and software components to collect and exchange data.

Collecting and exchanging data involves input, output, storage, and processing. When possible, students should select the hardware and software components for their project designs by considering factors such as functionality, cost, size, speed, accessibility, and aesthetics. For example, components for a mobile app could include accelerometer, GPS, and speech recognition. The choice of a device that connects wirelessly through a Bluetooth connection versus a physical USB connection involves a tradeoff between mobility and the need for an additional power source for the wireless device.

## Learning Outcomes/Goals

In this lesson, students will use a story concept -- restoring fireflies to the forest -- to design a project that uses a Micro:bit emulator to simulate the collection and exchange of data. 

Discussions can be held as well about how sensors can be used to collect data about the real world, especially by services that monitor important data pertaining to air quality, soil humidity, water temperature, and barometric pressure.

Students can work individually or in groups to sketch out their design to make a firefly trapper, based on their research of how fireflies behave and their optimal environment.

Students should consider how they would design a device that has to work outside in diverse climate conditions. They should think about power sources and how to make the device work efficiently. While their optimal trapper may not be able to be fully designed in the Micro:bit terminal, their sketch could show how they would add additional functionality to the device outside of the project recipe.

## Differentiated Instruction

Lower level students | Higher level students
---|---
Can complete the project recipe in the emulator and explain how they would enhance it | Can try the project on a real device and enhance it with a motion sensor

## Transfer Learning

Designing a 'trap' concept brings to mind the many ways that scientists tag animals in the wild to track their movements. Discuss real-world ways that sensors are used right now in camera traps, smart tagging, and micro-chipping animals to determine populations and keep pets safe. Students can research interesting real-life 'trap' type projects, discovering how they are designed to gather and exchange data between devices.

## Vocabulary

- **The Cloud**: A 'cloud' is a network of computers and devices that are connected to each other. We access the cloud every day when we check a service like Gmail. It can be differentiated from 'on premises' servers which reside on location.

- **LED**: An LED is a "light emitting diode" that emits light when current runs through it. The 'hello world', or most basic program of a hardware project is often flashing an LED. Learn more [here](https://thinglearn.jenlooper.com/curriculum/led.html).

- **Variable**: In programming, a variable is a value that can be changed. For example, a variable named 'x' can be changed to a different value. Variables are used to store values in memory.

- **Breadboard**: A breadboard is a physical board that is used to connect electronic components together. Use a breadboard to prototype a hardware project before any soldering is needed to make wired connections permanent.

- **Pins**: A pin is a physical connection between an electronic component and a breadboard.

## Assessment

In this chapter, the students are tasked with thinking about a hardware system and choosing the appropriate components to accomplish the goals of the system.

Formative | Summative
---|---
Research how decisions are made by engineers to build hardware and software solutions appropriate for the task at hand and for the environment where they will be embedded. Sketch out a design for an optimal trap for fireflies. | Write a summary of the trap's goals and outcome, and outline three ways that the trap would be designed to withstand outdoor conditions.
