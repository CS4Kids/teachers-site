### Systematically identify and fix problems with computing devices and their components.

Since a computing device may interact with interconnected devices within a system, problems may not be due  to the specific computing device itself but to devices connected to it. Just as pilots use checklists to  troubleshoot problems with aircraft systems, students should use a similar, structured process to troubleshoot  problems with computing systems and ensure that potential solutions are not overlooked. Examples of  troubleshooting strategies include following a troubleshooting flow diagram, making changes to software to  see if hardware will work, checking connections and settings, and swapping in working components.
