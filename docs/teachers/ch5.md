#### Model the role of protocols in transmitting data across networks and the Internet

Protocols are rules that define how messages between computers are sent. They determine how quickly and securely information is transmitted across networks and the Internet, as well as how to handle errors in transmission. Students should model how data is sent using protocols to choose the fastest path, to deal with missing information, and to deliver sensitive data securely. For example, students could devise a plan for resending lost information or for interpreting a picture that has missing pieces. The priority at this grade level is understanding the purpose of protocols and how they enable secure and errorless communication. Knowledge of the details of how specific protocols work is not expected.
